                        <h3>Kamari Beach</h3>
                        <img src="/Images/Kamari beach.jpeg" alt="Photo of Kamari beach" height="200">
                        <p>This gorgeous black-sand beach is located on the southeast of Santorini, right at the foot of Mesa Vuono Mountain. It's a great place to sunbathe and swim—it's been awarded the Blue Flag for its clean and clear waters after all. There are lots more to do too—there are sun loungers and umbrellas for rent, Greek taverns and bars nearby, and water sports like jetskiing. Just be sure to wear protective footwear as the pebbly terrain can be sharp and hot. It's best to arrive early, especially during the summer, for fewer crowds.

                            This beach is a common stop on a tour of Santorini, where you can explore more of the island with the help of an experienced guide. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g658914-d2663198-Reviews-Kamari_Beach-Kamari_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html" target="_blank">Read more</a>

                        <img src="/Images/Akrotiri.jpeg" alt="Photo of Landmark-Akrotiri" height="200">
                        <p>Akrotiri (Greek: Ακρωτήρι, pronounced Greek: [akroˈtiri]) was a Cycladic Bronze Age settlement on the volcanic Greek island of Santorini (Thera).

                            The settlement was destroyed in the Theran eruption sometime in the 16th century BC[1] and buried in volcanic ash, which preserved the remains of fine frescoes and many objects and artworks. Akrotiri has been excavated since 1967 after earlier excavations on Santorini. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)"target="_blank">Read more</a>
